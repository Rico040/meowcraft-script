# Meowcraft
This program changes content of sounds.json to turn every sound into game to a random cat idle sound, it turns out to be bad as Minecraft doesn't change every sound for some reason, so think of it as a first attempt to do something silly.

## Usage
Build program with `cargo build` and place `sounds.json` file along with executable. It will create `output.json` with corresponding changes. Now you can make resource pack.

## Why Rust?
Why not?
